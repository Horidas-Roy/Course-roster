•State management in this assignment project:

At first, I initialize the state variables,When component is first rendered, these variables are set to their initial values.Then,to update the variables,we can use the corresponding update functions (setSelectCourses, setTotalPrice, setTotalCreditOurs, setRemainingCreditOurs) provided by the useState hook.These functions accept new values and trigger a re-render of handleSelect function with the updated state.Then I handle user interaction based by some condition(such as limite credit hours or course not select more than one).Then I use these state in UI .By managing these state variables and their updates within this project component, I use dynamic and responsive user interfaces in this project.
